## Description

This library book application allows users to add books to their library by name, author, page number and allows them to check if they have read it or not. They can later adjust this if they do eventually read the book. They can also delete books from their library. This project focused on using JavaScript constructors. Additionally I would like to re-visit the project and add the books to local storage so that the content remains when the user ends the session. 

#### Technologies

- JavaScript
- HTML
